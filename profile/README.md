Dasharo is a coreboot downstream which values open development, firmware
resilience, platform security transparency, right to repair and digital
sovereignty. Dasharo benefits from 3mdeb CI/CD, documentation and firmware
optimization of more than half a million commercial units of x86 hardware with
open-source firmware.

Dasharo is a registered trademark and product developed by
[3mdeb](https://github.com/3mdeb).

Dasharo and related product services improved over **250k Intel-based
platforms** and over **500k AMD-based platforms**. Together we contributed
almost **50k lines of code** to various embedded firmware open-source projects.
We also developed more than **20k lines of code** to support IBM POWER9-based
Raptor Engineering Talos II in coreboot, which we are currently upstreaming.

<!-- data checkpoint  13.09.2023 -->

Since **March 2015** we provided **176** open-source firmware releases to the
community.

<!--

- TBD - provide more statistics
