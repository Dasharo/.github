## Hi there, we are Dasharo Team  üëã

</p>

We are building Dasharo open-source firmware distribution focusing on clean and
simple code, long-term maintenance, transparent validation, privacy-respecting
implementation, liberty for the owners, and trustworthiness for all.

Dasharo is a registered trademark and product developed by
[3mdeb](https://github.com/3mdeb).

Dasharo and related product services improved over **150k Intel-based
platforms** and over **500k AMD-based platforms**. Together we contributed
almost **40k lines of code** to various embedded firmware open-source projects.
We also developed more than **20k lines of code** to support IBM POWER9-based
Raptor Engineering Talos II in coreboot, which we are currently upstreaming.

Since **March 2015** we provided **165** open-source firmware releases to the
community.

- TBD - provide more statistics

## Community importance

We believe that friendly community and cooperation are key to building
a thriving open-source firmware ecosystem. Because of that, we would like to
invite you to:

* [Dashro Matrix Community](https://matrix.to/#/#dasharo:matrix.org) - where we
  discuss recent news related to open-source and closed firmware, help select
  hardware for porting, and provide support for Dasharo open-source firmware
  distribution compatible hardware.
* [Dasharo OSF vPub](https://vpub.dasharo.com/) - 3-4 times a year we organize
  an online party to discuss recent achievements in open-source firmware,
  open-source hardware, and open instruction set architecture. Feel free to
  check the website about recent vPub plans or subscribe to the
  [newsletter](https://newsletter.3mdeb.com/subscription/0_K65I7ro).
* There are also upcoming Dasharo Community Calls, Virtual and Live Hackathons
  as well as Live Coding sessions. If you would like to be informed about such
  events and other Dasharo-related updates feel free to sign up for our
  [newsletter](https://newsletter.3mdeb.com/subscription/wwL90UkXP).
* We also care about education in the community by contributing to
  [OpenSecurityTraining2](https://ost2.fyi/). Feel free to check our courses
  [Arch4021: Introductory UEFI](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+4021_Intro_UEFI+2022_v1/about)
  and [Arch4031: Introductory coreboot](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+Arch4031_x86-64_RV_coreboot+2021_v1/about).
